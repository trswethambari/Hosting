        <p>Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's legacy transcends his roles as a scientist, leader, and educator. He left behind a
            lasting impact on India and the world through his vision, humility, and unwavering dedication to uplifting
            society.</p>
        <ol type="value">
            <li>
                <p><h6>Missile and Space Programs</h6>
                    Dr. Kalam is often called the "Missile Man of India" for his contributions to the development of
                    India’s missile technology. His leadership in the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program
                    (IGMDP) resulted in the successful creation of missiles like Agni and Prithvi, significantly
                    boosting India’s defense capabilities. His work in space technology, particularly the Satellite
                    Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) that put Rohini in orbit, marked India's early success in space
                    exploration. His efforts paved the way for India to become a major player in both defense and space
                    research.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><h6>Inspiration for Education and Youth</h6>
                    Dr. Kalam’s deep connection with students and youth remains one of his most enduring legacies. Even
                    after his presidency, he spent much of his time interacting with students, encouraging them to dream
                    big, pursue science, and contribute to the nation’s progress. His books, especially "Wings of Fire"
                    and "Ignited Minds", continue to inspire millions, urging them to take responsibility for their
                    future and that of the country. His speeches and writings instilled a sense of purpose and ambition
                    in young minds.</p>

            <li>
                <p><h6>Vision for a Developed India</h6>

                    transforming India into a developed nation by focusing on technological advancements, agricultural
                    growth, healthcare improvements, and sustainable development. Though he passed before this vision
                    was fully realized, his ideas continue to influence policymakers, technologists, and entrepreneurs
                    who are working to make India a global powerhouse.</p>

                    for his service to humanity, and he was revered as a global thinker dedicated to peace, prosperity,
                    and the betterment of society.</p>

                    greatness through hard work and kindness are key parts of his legacy.</p>

                <p><h6>Enduring Influence on Future Generations</h6>

                    of Management Shillong, symbolized his lifelong commitment to education and youth. His legacy is
                    carried forward by initiatives like the Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Foundation, which promotes education,
                    healthcare, and rural development.</p>
